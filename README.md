# Web Programming Project
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The project task is to develop an on-line movie search application for the SMT Movie Rental company
(a fictitious name/business).

I have included a Java Application project (`PrototypeSite`) which is there to facilitate the generation 
of the prototype site.
